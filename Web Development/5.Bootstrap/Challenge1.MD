This is the first challenge on learning Bootstrap. 

Twitter Bootstrap is one of the most popular front-end frameworks. This is a *challenge*: It won't be easy, but it will help you learn to learn and search. This challenges is supposed to be done in Pair Programming. 

1. Create your HTML file.

2. You can add Bootstrap to any app by adding the following code to the HTML.:
	<link rel="stylesheet" href="//maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css"/>
Normally, you will want to use your customized Bootstrap code. So, instead of adding that line, go to the following link: http://getbootstrap.com/customize Go to the bottom of the site and click on compile and download. This will download a zip file with all the files needed for Bootstrap. Copy the directory (Bootstrap) to the same directory of your HTML file.

3. In Bootstrap, we have a .container, .rows and .cols. Create a div that works as a container, put two or three rows, and then separate in columns. As in our own framework, Bootstrap columns add up to 12. Let's understand this deeply. First, read the Introduction to the main layout and explain it to your partner:
	http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid-intro

Now, check which options you have at:
	http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid-options

4. Play a little with your rows. Create a row of 12 columns, another of 3 equally divided columns, one row of 8 columns and 4 columns. Use medium columns for now (.col-md-*). If you can't see anything, remember to put some text in each div and some border.

5. Now, let's make this adaptable (look different on different sizes). Read the following StackOverflow Question:

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19865158/what-is-the-difference-among-col-lg-col-md-and-col-sm-in-twitter-bootstra

Change your grid so it has different behavior on different sizes. If you are curious, the breakpoints used for lg, md, etc can be checked here: http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid-media-queries

6. Change .container to .container-fluid. Understand what is going on.


Additional challenges

1. Check the section on offsetting columns and play a little with that. Center elements, put a column to the right, etc.
