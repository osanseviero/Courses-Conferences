This is the second challenge on learning Bootstrap. 

1. Create a new HTML file and link it to Bootstrap.

2. Create 5 headings (h1, h2, ...) with some text in each one.

3. Use small to add a secondary text in the headings. Be careful where you put the tag! (http://getbootstrap.com/css/#type-headings).

4. Create a paragraph with some text. Hint: If you have Emmet, put lorem and press Tab and it will create a nice little paragraph. Now play with some tags: <mark>, <del>, <s>, <ins>, and <u>. Be careful to close them and to understand each of them.

5. Use the alignment classes to align things in specific places. How easy is it to center! (http://getbootstrap.com/css/#type-inline-text)

6. Create a table with 3 rows. Use tables, not Bootstrap rows. (http://getbootstrap.com/css/#tables-example). Add the .table-striped class and see what happens. Change .table-striped to .table-hover.

7. Create some buttons and see what happens. Use some of the options.: http://getbootstrap.com/css/#buttons
