Responsive Web Development & Design Challenge
===============

# Implement Layout Shifter.
1. Check the design: https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/design-and-ui/responsive/patterns/imgs/layout-shifter.svg
2. Consider the correct media queries (600px and 800px sound right, but play with them).
3. Remember, mobile first!
4. If you have problems to put the element at the left, put another div to contain the rest.

# Building Google Homepage
1. Don't be a perfectionist, the object here is to create the main structure and layout of the website. Don't add dropdowns or other complex things. If you can't accomplish something, remember to search at Google and don't get frustated.
2. Put the main divs of the website (the navbar, the main image, the form, the footer). Put divs, this is important. Don't add style yet.
3. Put all the content that is inside the navbar: gmail, images, grid, picture, etc. Then, try to position the elements at the right. Check this if you have problems, but use flexbox. http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_navbar.asp
4. Fill the footer.
5. Finish something like this. Don't worry if you're not done. http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/miguelsxvi/google-homepage/blob/master/index.html
